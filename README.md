To Do List - Flutter App 


This To-Do App lets users organize tasks across multiple tabs, such as General, Academics, and a Water Tracker. Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed with a checkbox, and swipe to delete them. All data is saved locally on the device, so tasks and water progress remain even after closing the app. Water progress is reset at the end of the day as it is more of a daily goal. 

The app is designed to be easy to use and minimalistic, showing how Flutter can manage state, store data locally (Hive), and build responsive user interfaces with multiple pages.
